Exif Data Extraction for Jamroom 5
==================================

ujExif is a Jamroom 5 module which can extract exif data from uploaded photos, and optionally store it for other modules to use.

It triggers a listener so your modules can grab and use the exif data during image upload/save.

You can optionally select to save the full extracted exif data to the ujExif database table for specified modules.
An exif_id is saved as an _image_exif field with the jrImage data so a large array doesn't encumber the image, yet can be retrieved whenever it is needed by other modules now or in the future.
##Example - ujGoogleMaps grabs lat/lng gps data

ujGoogleMaps listens for exif data attached to photos uploaded to jrGallery.<br>
It uses the data to extract the photo gps coordinates and adds latitude and longitude fields to the gallery image for displaying on a map.

ujGoogleMaps has the following code in its init function:
<pre>
jrCore_register_event_listener('ujExif','extract_exif_data','ujGoogleMaps_deal_with_exif_data_listener');
</pre>


And the following function in its include.php:

<pre>
function ujGoogleMaps_deal_with_exif_data_listener($_data,$_user,$_conf,$_args,$event) {
    if ($_args['module'] == 'jrGallery') { // check we only do this for specified modules
        $exif = $_data['exif'];
		if(!$exif['GPSLatitude']) { 
		    return $_data;
		} else {
		    $lat = $exif['GPSLatitude']; 
			$lng = $exif['GPSLongitude'];
			
		    // Do stuff with GPS coordinates here
		    
		    // Then add back into the data array
		    // fields will be created as gallery_image_lat and gallery_image_lng
		    $_data["{$_args['file_name']}_lat"] = $lat;
			$_data["{$_args['file_name']}_lng"] = $lng;
		}
    }
    return $_data;
}
</pre>

When the gallery image is then saved to the database it will have additional fields created as gallery_image_lat and gallery_image_lng.


Here is an example of the $_data array received by ujGoogleMaps_deal_with_exif_data_listener.

It uses the GPS data from the photo to add a location to photos uploaded to jrGallery so that it can display groups of photos on a map. Your module will likely have a different usage because ujGoogleMaps is really cool and you should check it out if you need to use photo locations on your site or in your modules - it will save you a lot of time.


##Installation

Upload the module to your server.

Go to the module info tab in the admin control panel and enable it.
